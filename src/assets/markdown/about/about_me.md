title: about me
---
I'm Tyler Norbury, a software engineer living in Portland, Oregon.

I graduated from George Fox University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science, after which I worked at Tektronix for 2 years, where I developed the front-end of test and measurement equipment using QT. Since then I've transitioned to developing and publishing my app, Music Note, while also pursuing freelance work.

In my free time I love developing websites & mobile apps, photography, and learning German!
