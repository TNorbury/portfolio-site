title: about me
---
I'm Tyler Norbury, a software engineer living in Portland, Oregon.

I graduated from George Fox University in 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and since then I've been working at Tektronix, where I work to develop test and measurement equipment.

In my free time I love developing websites & mobile apps, photography, and learning German!
